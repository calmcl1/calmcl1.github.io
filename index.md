# Hi there!

I'm Cal McLean - not a developer but I tend to write software and little utilities in my spare time.
These tend to exist simply to make my life easier, but like they say -- sharing is caring ;)

I work in the vision mixer for TV as my day job, and maintain the technical infrastructure behind [Halton Community Radio](http://hcr923fm.com) (a community station in the north-west of the UK, where I grew up) in my spare time in the UK. I keep in touch with, and occasionally write some bits and pieces for my old friends from my time as a theatre technician!

## Projects
Most of my available projects pertain to the radio or broadcasting industry, mostly because that's where I work. I believe in [eating my own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food), so many of these projects are in use in a production environment somewhere.

### Chronicle
[Chronicle](projects/chronicle) is a Record-of-Transmission logger for radio.
